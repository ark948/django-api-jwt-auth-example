20. check the following routes:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/user/register/ (to register new users)
create a new user: bob-loop123*

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/ (to obtain tokens)
make post request with the credentials of the user created previously

if POST was successful, two tokens should be returned, access token and refresh token.
this is what the frontend will store, (usually in LocalStorage)

http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/token/refresh/ (to refresh the access token using refresh token)
if you pass the refresh token of user 'bob' in this route, a new access token will be returned
